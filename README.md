# splice-infrastructure
Splice is a realism-first AI infrastructure that places AI into defined locations, roles, and workflows. It governs how synthetic media and task-based intelligence behave in real environments, enforcing physical accuracy, natural imperfection, and purpose-driven action—not standalone generation.

Splice is not a video generator.


It is a realism governance layer.
Splice sits between intent and output, approving or rejecting realism compliance.
This repository defines how AI-generated media and systems must behave
to remain physically believable, humanly accurate, and visually natural.

## What This Is
- A realism-first infrastructure framework
- A governing layer above generators
- A standard that prevents synthetic artifacts
- A foundation for future media, simulation, and systems

## What This Is Not
- Not a prompt pack
- Not a cosmetic AI tool
- Not a hype demo
- Not locked to any vendor

## Core Focus Areas
- Human motion integrity
- Physical realism (gravity, weight, resistance)
- Natural skin, sound, and imperfection
- Camera behavior that feels filmed, not rendered
- Infrastructure-grade scalability

## Current Status
- Phase 1: Doctrine & Standards
- Video outputs are used as proof, not product

## Guiding Principle
If it looks generated, it failed.
If it looks perfect, it failed.
If it looks real, Splice is working.

Reality is not clean.
Reality is not symmetrical.
Reality is not optimized for beauty.

Splice enforces realism through:
- Imperfection
- Physical limitation
- Environmental interaction
- Human fatigue and error

Any system that violates these principles
is considered non-compliant.
